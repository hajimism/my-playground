## Tips

### Change color

This template is now Green/Sage based. You can choose the combination freely, such as Violet/Mauve based or Blue/Slate based.

Check the palette to customize effectively.

### Use scaffdog

When adding a new ui component, `npx scaffdog generate ui` will speed up your first steps.

Feel free to edit the templates or add new ones of your own.
